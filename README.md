# Binance-Crypto-Currency-Value-Program
A clean C++ code that tracks and shows crypto currency market pricings from Binance, the aim of the program is to show the total value of the given crypto currency in the user's wallet.
Remember to replace "YOUR_BINANCE_API_KEY" and "YOUR_BINANCE_SECRET_KEY" with your actual Binance API key and secret. Also, ensure to have the necessary libraries installed (like libcurl and jsoncpp) and linked properly.
Please note that this code uses the Binance API to fetch cryptocurrency prices. The user needs to have a Binance API key and secret to use this code.
